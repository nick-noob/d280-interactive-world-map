# D280 Interactive World Map

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
I also removed the `node_modules` directory because it is large and unnecessary for GitHub.
So, you will need to run `npm install` to reinstall Node.JS for the application to run.
